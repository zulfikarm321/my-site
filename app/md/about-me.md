# Hey, I’m ZUL 👋

I’m a person endlessly curious about how the world works — both the visible systems and the quiet patterns underneath them.  
I like learning about almost anything: technology, design, philosophy, and the way people think and create meaning.  
I don’t chase expertise — I chase understanding. Every day is another attempt to see things a little clearer.

## Why I Built This Space

This website is my small corner of the internet — a place to write, reflect, and document what I learn along the way.  
Some things you’ll find here are half-formed thoughts, some are deep dives, and some are just quiet notes to myself.  
That’s intentional. I believe growth happens in fragments — not in perfect essays.

> “We are all unfinished works — learning, unlearning, and rebuilding.”

## Beyond the Screen

Outside of the code and text, I enjoy observing small, quiet details —  
how light moves through a room, how people talk when they’re at ease,  
how ideas connect when you stop trying to control them.

Those moments, I think, are where real creativity lives.

## A Work in Progress

This space isn’t about perfection.  
It’s about process — documenting what I learn, what I fail at, and what I’m still trying to understand.  
If any of my words make you pause, reflect, or simply feel seen,  
then this little corner of the web has already done what it was meant to do.
