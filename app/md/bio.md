## Hey, I’m ZUL 👋

A person who’s endlessly curious about the world and how things work.

I like learning about almost anything — technology, design, philosophy, human behavior, and the quiet moments that make life feel real.  
I don’t claim to be an expert in any of these, but I find joy in the process of figuring things out — the research, the experiments, the failures, the tiny breakthroughs that make everything worth it.
