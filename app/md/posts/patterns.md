# Patterns and Meaning

I keep noticing patterns —  
in how I think, how I move, how I return to the same questions again and again.  
It’s strange how repetition can be both comfort and trap.

Maybe patterns are how life teaches gently,  
offering the same lesson until I’m ready to learn it.  
Maybe meaning isn’t hidden — it’s simply repeated  
until I finally pay attention.

The world keeps whispering.  
Most days, I’m just trying to listen.
