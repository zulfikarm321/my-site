# Fragments of Curiosity

I don’t chase mastery. I chase understanding.  
The kind that grows slowly, through observation, silence, and the occasional mistake.

Learning isn’t a race toward knowing more — it’s the practice of noticing what’s already here.  
A word, a sound, a thought that lingers longer than expected.  
Every detail is a doorway if I’m patient enough to see it.

I used to think I needed to know everything to start creating.  
Now I realize that creation itself is the way of knowing.  
Writing is how I listen to my own thoughts until they become clear.

This website isn’t meant to impress or to prove anything.  
It’s a small space to breathe, to think, and to remember that curiosity is enough.
