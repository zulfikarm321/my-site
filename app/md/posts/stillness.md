# The Quiet Between Things

I’ve learned that silence is rarely empty.  
It holds the space where thoughts form — fragile, unpolished, and honest.

In a world that moves too fast, stillness feels like rebellion.  
It’s not about doing nothing.  
It’s about giving attention to what’s already happening,  
without rushing to name it or fix it.

Sometimes, meaning appears only when I stop searching for it.  
Sometimes, clarity is what’s left when the noise fades.
