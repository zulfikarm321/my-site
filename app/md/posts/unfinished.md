# The Beauty of Being Unfinished

There’s a strange peace in accepting that I’ll never be complete.  
Every idea I have will shift. Every opinion will soften.  
Every version of myself will eventually be replaced by another.

Perfection used to feel like a destination.  
Now it feels like a cage.

Growth happens in the in-between —  
in the drafts, the mistakes, the half-written thoughts.  
That’s where life actually lives.

This space, this website, this journey — none of it is finished.  
And that’s exactly why it matters.
