# Learning in Public

Sometimes I feel like my mind is a messy web of half-finished ideas, open tabs, and random notes.  
But that’s exactly why I started this website — to make sense of the chaos by writing it out.

I’ve always been curious about how things work: how we think, how we build, how we connect.  
And somewhere along the way, I realized that learning isn’t something that happens in silence.  
It’s messy, visible, and sometimes awkward — and that’s fine.

Sharing what I learn, even when it’s unfinished, makes me pay attention.  
It forces me to explain things better, to find patterns, to see growth where I didn’t notice it before.  
This site is part journal, part lab — a small space where curiosity gets to wander without judgment.

If you’re reading this, maybe you’re curious too.  
Maybe you also enjoy figuring things out, even when the process feels uncertain.  
Either way, I hope you find something here that sparks a thought, a question, or just a quiet “huh, that’s interesting.”
